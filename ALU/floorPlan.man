Name
       floorPlan - Specifies the floorplan dimensions by size; or by die, I/O, or core coordinates. The floorPlan command initializes the floorplan and calls the add_trackscommand to create new routing tracks

Description
       Specifies the floorplan dimensions by size; or by die, I/O, or core coordinates. The floorPlan command initializes the floorplan and calls the add_trackscommand to create new routing tracks. By default  the add_tracks command
       calculates the optimum spacing between tracks and ignores the pitch values in the tech LEF.  When you use the Specify Floorplan form (or specify the floorplan through the floorplan command), the floorplan is resized automati-
       cally- relatively floorplan constraints are automatically derived on the fly for blocks, fixed standard cells, fixed pre-routes, and blockages.

       The floorplan is linearly adjusted as follows:

              * Spacing among blocks is evenly adjusted

              * The size of the modules and black boxes is evenly adjusted.

              * The fixed pre-routes and I/Os are automatically adjusted.

       Note: The floorPlan command checks if the specified IO box and core box is within limits of die box and displays an error message if they are outside the die box.


Parameters
       -adjustToSite
              Adjusts the width of the die area such that it is an integer multiple of the width of the IO site or core site.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -b {<die_box io_box core_box>}
              Specifies all three boxes of the floorplan, die_box, io_box, core_box.

              The following command creates floorplan by specifying a core box size of 1200 x 1200,io box size of 1600 x 1600  and die box size of 2000 x 2000.

              floorPlan -b {0 0 2000 2000 200 200 1800 1800 400 400 1600 1600}
