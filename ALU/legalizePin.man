Description
       Moves a pin from its existing location. It moves the pins in the following cases:

              * The pin overlaps with any other object or pin. The objects considered are:The pin violates pin-to-pin spacing constraints

                * stripes

                * vias

                * feedthrough buffers

                * routing blockages

                * pin blockages

              * The pin is on a non-preferred layer, a non-reserved layer, or the Metal1 layer

              * The pin is not on the routing track

              * The pin does not honor corner mask settings

       The pin is assigned to the nearest legal location.

       Note:  If  this command is run on a blackbox that has one or more pins with a single LEF port but with multiple shapes within the LEF port, the command will remove these multiple shapes and create a single shape. If this com-
       mand is run on a blackbox that has one or more pins with multiple LEF ports, the first LEF port will be processed as per the command and the remaining LEF ports will remain unchanged.

       The legalizePin command supports nested partitions and corrects the pin position of illegal pins across hierarchies. It gives a warning if the first level pin is placed in second level partition or vice  versa  and  legalizes
       them to the nearest track. It also supports pin overlapping across N levels for overlapping partition boundaries.

       The  legalizePin  command  honors  net weights and accordingly legalizes pins. For example, if there are 2 or 3 pins that can be put into a slot, the legalizePin command automatically looks at the net weight of these pins and
       assigns the slot according the net weight priority.


Parameters
       -help  Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for each legalizePin parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command: man legalizePin

       -auto_pairing
              Automatically calculates the channel width or distance between pins in a design which will be considered for pairing.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -exclude_ptn <ptnName>
              Specifies the list of excluded partition for pin file.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -exclude_pin_file <fileName>
              Specifies pin-list to be excluded for partition in a file.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -ignore {pin_spacing pin_spacing_constraint pin_spacing_routeBlk pin_width pin_depth pin_layer pin_min_area pin_on_track pin_abutment pin_non_nbr_abutment clones pin_color}
              Legalizes by taking the category(ies) of ignore types into account.

              Data_type: (enum)+, optional

       -internalPin
              Legalizes internal pins by moving them to the closest track on the preferred routing layer.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -keepLayer
              Maintains the pin layer while legalizing the pins. If the pin is on a layer that is not on the allowed partition layer list then an error is reported and the pin is not legalized.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -keepOrder
              Maintains the pin order while legalizing pins irrespective of the layers. Initially, the pins are legalized within the range of original pin locations. However, if the legalizePin -keepOrder command is unable to find a
              legal location, legalizePin will try to find a valid location that is outside the original range and give warning message. If legalizePin fails to find a valid location, it reports an error.

              Note: The option is only applicable for pins on the fence. It does not apply to internal pins.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -moveFixedPin
              If you use this parameter, the specified pins with a Fixed status can also be moved.

              Note: Pins that are not specified but have a Fixed status are not moved.


              Default: If you do not specify this option, the specified pins with a Fixed status are not moved.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -ptn <ptnName>
              Specifies the partition for which the pins will be checked. This parameter is required if the partition is not the top-level module.

              Note: The legalizePin command can also resolve I/O pins from overlapping power stripes. In this case, ptnName specifies the block-level design name.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -pin {<pinName> | <pinNameList>}
              Specifies that the command should be run on the specified pin(s) only.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -pin_file <fileName>
              Specifies the pin list for a partition in a file. In the pin file, the pins and nets are specified in the following format:

              Partition: PtnName/BlockName

              <Pin1>

              <Pin2>

              <..>

              Partition: PtnName/BlockName

              <Pin1>

              <Pin2>

              <..>

              Nets:

              <netA>

              <netB>

              <..>

              Note: While specifying the pin list in the pin_file, it is necessary to give the Partition keyword followed by the name of the partition or block. If this is not specified, no operations are performed.  You can specify
              multiple partitions in the same pin_file.

              The pin_file does not support buses or wild cards for pin names. If a pin specified in the list or a partition is not present in the design, a warning is displayed.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -snapToBoundary
              Snaps internal partition pins to the boundary and legalizes them.

              Note: The -snapToBoundary parameter does not work with -internalPin as both work on internal pins and their results are different.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -verbose
              Reports all the existing pin violations.

              Data_type: bool, optional


Example
       The following command legalizes pins in same the metal as they were present and moves fixed pins if they are placed illegally:

       legalizePin -keepLayer -moveFixedPin

       The following command accepts a file that contains the list of pins for partition A and partition B and legalizes them.

       legalizePin -ptn {A B} -pin_file pinLst.txt

       where, the <pinList.txt>

       Partition: top

       out1

       out2

       out3

       Partition: A

       in1

       in2

       in3

       Partition: B

       pina

       pinb

       pinc
