Description
       Checks the generated partition pins and I/O pins for the following:

              * Pins are assigned to the proper metal layer depending on the side of the partition

              * Pins are assigned within the range of layers reserved for the partition

              * Any particular location on a routing layer has only one pin assigned

              * Pins are assigned on the routing track

              * Pins have a valid spacing from:

                * routing blockages

                * power pins and ground pins

              * Pins have the correct size, status, and type

              * Pin assignment follows the minimum area rule

              * If the -minArea parameter is specified, the command checks for and reports the pins that are:

                * floating from inside (that is, the pins that are connected only to the top level)

                * floating from both inside the partition and at the top level.

              * Pins follow the keep out spacing constraints for a pin group or net group and reports any violations in pin spacing.

              * Checks and reports pin violations on clones in a master clone design.

       The  summary report generated by the command also includes information about feedthrough pins. These reports also provide a summary for all pins of the partition, blackbox, and the top module. However, summary report for pins
       is only displayed when there are multiple objects. It does not provide such a summed up pin summary report when we use the checkPinAssignment command for individual objects. For example, when you use the -ptn option, the sum-
       mary report for all pins is not displayed.

       Note:

              * The checkPinAssignment command honors preferred routing layer attributes as soft constraint during pin assignment and reports violations in pin layers as an error.

              * You can use this command after running early global routing and then partitioning with pin assignment.

              * If  this  command  is  run  on a blackbox that has one or more pins with a single LEF port but with multiple shapes within the LEF port, the command will check violations only with respect to the first shape and will
                ignore all other shapes. If this command is run on a blackbox that has one or more pins with multiple LEF ports, the command will check violations only with respect to the first LEF port and will ignore all other LEF
                ports.

              * The checkPinAssignment command supports nested partitions and reports the pin status for pins of nested partitions.

              * Each  time  the  checkPinAssignment command is run, it automatically refreshes the violations as properties of pins. It clears all violation properties on all pins and populates fresh violation properties on each pin
                based on the latest checkPinAssignment results. These properties are persistent in save/restore DB. You can query results of the pin violations report generated by the checkPinAssignment command to automate the flow.
                For example:

                * To query for all partition pins with depth violation, you can use the following query:

                  get_db [get_db partitions .master -if {.obj_type == hinst}] .local_hpins -if {.vio_depth == 1}

                * To query for all pins (partition pins, bbox pins and IO pins) with depth violation, you can use the following query:

                  puts [concat \

                  [get_db ports -if {.vio_depth == 1}] \

                  [get_db [get_db partitions .master -if {.obj_type == inst}] .pins -if {.vio_depth == 1}] \

                  [get_db [get_db partitions .master -if {.obj_type == hinst}] .local_hpins -if {.vio_depth == 1}] \

                  ]

                * To query for all pins in a master partition having pin depth violations, you can use the following query:

                  get_db [get_db partitions .master -if {.obj_type == hinst && .name == S}] .local_hpins -if {.vio_depth == 1}

       -outFile <fileName>
              Specifies that in addition to displaying the report on screen, the command should also print the output in the specified file.

              Default: <design_name>.checkPin.rpt

              Data_type: string, optional

       -pin {<pinName> | <pinNameList>}
              Specifies that the command should be run on the specified pin(s) only.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -pin_file <fileName>
              Specifies the pin list for a partition in a file.

              In the pin file, the pins and nets are specified in the following format:

              Partition: <PtnName/BlockName> <Pin1> <Pin2> <..> <PinN>

              Partition:<PtnName/BlockName> <Pin1> <Pin2> <..> <PinN>

              Nets:<><netA><netB ..netN>

              Note: While specifying the pin list in the pin_file, it is necessary to give the Partition keyword followed by the name of the partition or block. If this is not specified, no operations are performed.  You can specify
              multiple partitions in the same pin_file.

              The pin_file does not support buses or wild cards for pin names. If a pin specified in the list or a partition is not present in the design, a warning is displayed.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -preCheck
              Checks for the feasibility of pin assignment mainly to catch the reason for unplaced pins in fully abutted design.

              Note: No other checkPinAssignment command parameter can be used if -preCheck is being used.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -ptn <partitionName>
              Specifies the partition for which the pins will be checked. This parameter is required if the partition is not the top-level module.

              Reports the pins (connected to same net) placed at the same location and the same layer as overlap violation.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -report_violating_pin
              Reports all the pins with violations.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -skipCheck {overlap layer spacingConstraint fixedIoPins multiTermNet masterClone netGroup connection relativeOrientRelation gridTrackAlignment symmetryOffset masterCloneSize alignZone}
              Skips checking the category from the list of type of checks. This parameter is used with the -preCheck parameter.

              * overlap: When specified, the command skips checking for any partition fences which are overlapping.

              * layer: When specified, the command skips checking for allowed layers on abutted edges of partition.

              * spacingConstraint: When specified, the command skips checking for spacing on abutted edges.

              * fixedIoPins: When specified, the command skips checking if the block pin is placed on an abutted edge with its connected partition.

              * multiTermNet: When specified, the command skips checking for multi partition pin nets in abutted design.

              * masterClone: When specified, the command skips checking for master and clone partitions.

              * netGroup: When specified, the command skips checking the net group ordering check in master and clone.

              * connection: When specified, the command skips checking if symmetric abutted designs have each master-clone pair connected to same pin.

              * relativeOrientRelation: When specified, the command skips checking the clone inside clone orientation. The clone inside a clone should have a relative orientation with its parent which is  checked  with  master/clone
                inside master.

              * gridTrackAlignment: When specified, the command skips checking for routing track offset in Master-Clone design to avoid off grid pins.

              * symmetryOffset: When specified, the command skips checking if the clone to clone offset (relative distance on abutted edges) is same as in the master to master/clone connection pair. This is required so that the pins
                in each clone-clone and master-master/clone pair is the same.

              * masterCloneSize: When specified, the command skips checking the master-clone size. This is required to check the number of poly edges of clones with master and check each edge size for any mismatch.

              * alignZone: When specified, the command skips checking for the common alignment zone between master-clone and their connected partitions.


              Data_type: enum_list, optional

       <topCellName>
              Specifies the top cell name.

              Data_type: string, optional


Example

                checkPinAssignment -ptn tdsp_core -outFile reportViolation.txt

                The output will look like:

                Summary report for partition: [tdsp_core]

                Total Pins : 134
